Welcome to our Software System Analysis SE2232 Final Project.

Our project is called MyLibrary, as previously mentioned.

We tried to improve readability by adding comment lines.
Most of the function names clearly indicate what they do.

To use MyLibrary, simply run the LIBRARY class.

Other details and explanations are provided thoroughly in our report.
